# Screeni 
## Project Creation & Architecture Pattern
We shall follow a Modular Mechanism to implement the flow of the App. This makes the App easier to scale

| app                      | This is the main of the Application, this run and keeps activities intact                                       |
| channelcatch             | This is the module responsible for recording screen, internal audio, mic audio based on the Current API Version |
| plinth                   | Base Components Supplier for the whole app                                                                      |
